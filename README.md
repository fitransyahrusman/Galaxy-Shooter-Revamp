# Galaxy-Shooter-Revamp
Revamp version of my previous 2D Game

This is the master branch where I upload exaclty my previous 2D project game :
[Movement-Learning](https://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@github.com/fitransyahrusman/Movement-Learning) as a new repo.

Purpose of this project is to make significant change in code application.
By this meaning I'm trying the best way to apply some intermediate design pattern.
In order to achieve better performance and good coding practice.

In this project will showcasing simple application of :
- Observer pattern
- Singleton pattern
- Finite State Machine pattern
- Object pooling pattern
- Trio strategy, decorator and composite pattern

Also expect some coding principle such as :
- High Cohesion Loose Coupling
- Law of demeter principle
- Good practice of naming convention

In other way, this project purpose is to demosntrate my imporvement in Unity and C# since I start learning in 2021.

Workflow for this project is stated clearly in this step below :
1. Working mainly in this branch (master)
2. I will create a branch for specific work e.g (player, enemy, behaviour, ability etc)
3. After finish with the branch work, I'll create another sub branch within the mentioned branch as checkpoint.
4. Then I'll merge the branch back to master.

That's all, thank you for visiting here, enjoy coding!
